# ====================>> Assignment
# You may have heard that computers represent all data with binary numbers.
# In the binary number system, only two digits are used: 0 and 1. Contrast this to the decimal number system we are used to, which uses 10 digits: 0 through 9.
# In the decimal number system, when the least significant number is 9, and you +1 to that number, then the least significant number resets back to 0, and a 1 is added to the front of the number, producing 10. The same thing happens when you have 99, and you +1 to it. Then all the 9's reset to 0, and a 1 is added to the front of the number, producing 100.
# It works similarly in binary, except it will reset much quicker:
# 0        = 0
# 1        = 1
# 10       = 2
# 11       = 3
# 100      = 4
# 101      = 5
# 110      = 6
# 111      = 7
# 1000     = 8
# ...
# 11111111 = 255
# Write a method that can covert a string representing a binary number to a decimal number. You may assume that the string will only contain 0's and 1's.
# bin_to_dec('10')     --> 2
# bin_to_dec('101')    --> 5
# bin_to_dec('101100') --> 44
